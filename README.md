# ExamPrep

Develop a web application powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to transform students’ lecture notes and slides into a comprehensive, interactive study path. The application allows students to upload their notes or lecture slides, and the LLM will analyze the content, generating an organized ‘learning track’ that visually represents topics in sequence from the beginning to the end of the material. Each topic is displayed as a unique checkpoint on an intuitive, visually appealing track, much like a race course, guiding students from Topic 1 to Topic N.

The core functionality of the LLM is to break down each topic into easily digestible subtopics and create a series of quizzes tailored to each segment of content. For each topic checkpoint, the LLM generates a set of questions that range in difficulty from easy to challenging. Students can choose the type of questions they prefer (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, long answer, true/false, or a mixed format). The quiz will dynamically adjust to this preference, ensuring students receive practice in their preferred exam style.

Each quiz question includes:

Answer Feedback: Immediate insights on correctness, with detailed suggestions on how to improve answers, including helpful keywords or phrases.
Hints: An optional ‘Hint’ feature that provides students with guidance to think through questions.
The goal of this application is to provide a highly personalized and adaptive study experience, allowing students to practice questions that closely resemble their actual exams. The interface is designed for ease of use, with a clean, visually engaging UI that transforms traditional study sessions into an interactive, gamified experience.
